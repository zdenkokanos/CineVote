# Semestral project - subject Object Oriented Programming
The focus of my project is to create a voting system for the best film in various categories, the best director (male/female), or actor/actress of the year, as well as the option to vote for the best film of all time. Participants in the voting process will be divided into three groups: Admin, Middle Class, and Lower Class.
	•	Admin will have the ability to receive film nomination proposals, nominate films themselves, and vote exactly once in each category. Additionally, they will be the only ones who can view the voting progress and preliminary results.
	•	Middle Class will have the ability to propose nominations, which must be approved by the Admin, and they can also vote only once in each category. This group will also include film experts whose votes will have a weight of 2, and a group of analytical experts whose nominations will have higher priority during the approval process.
	•	Lower Class will only have the ability to vote and view the final statistics after voting concludes, just like the Middle Class.

During registration, participants will always be assigned the role of the Lower Class (i.e., higher roles are defined before the voting process begins).
